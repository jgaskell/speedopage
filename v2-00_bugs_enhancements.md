Bugs: 
1. One first loading, adding a car. This should not appear until the user creates an account. Severity 1
2. Adding a car is saying "authentication required": where does that come from? Severity 1
3. Summary Page is blank, there's no sample data or options to add it? Severity 2


Features to add:
1. Button for users to submit their run, so that not all data captured is submitted
2. Let users sort by run type or date
3. Let users continue as a guest, but then any data captured in that session can be uploaded if they decide to register
